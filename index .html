			  <p>The PWT IWT Wave World Tour features a 40-event calendar in 25 countries that include the iconic waves of Cabo Verde, the shallow reef power of Cloudbreak in Fiji, the freight train left-hander of Topocalma in Chile, the longest rideable wave in the world at Pacasmayo in Peru, and the historical heartland of wave sailing at Hookipa Beach in Maui.

The plan is to balance these venues with legendary jumping spots like Omaezaki in the southeast of Japan, the mighty Pozo Izquierdo, and the blue water magic of Tenerife, both in the Canary Islands and the island of Sylt on the stormy North Sea coast of Germany.

"This is nothing short of a revolution in the sport of windsurfing," notes PWA World Tour manager Richie Page.

"For the first time, the grassroots base is directly connected to the very top of the pyramid with a cohesive, unified global sports structure."</p>
